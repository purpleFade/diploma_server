# Practice_2024_Backend

This repository contains the backend service for the **Practice 2024 Project**, a microservice-based solution for analyzing and processing tactical images. The backend is built using Python, Flask, and OpenCV, designed to handle image analysis tasks efficiently and interact seamlessly with the frontend application.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Handles image uploads, processing, and returning results in JSON format.
- **Image Analysis**: Implements advanced image processing techniques using OpenCV (edge detection, object detection, and segmentation).
- **YOLOv3 Integration**: Leverages YOLOv3 for real-time object detection in tactical scenarios.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed with microservices principles for ease of extension and deployment.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core language for backend development.
- **Flask**: Lightweight framework for building REST APIs.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing and computer vision library.
- **YOLOv3**: Deep learning-based object detection.
- **Docker** (optional): Containerization for deployment.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/purpleFade/Practice_2024_backend.git
   cd Practice_2024_backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download YOLOv3 weights (if required):
   - Place `yolov3.weights`, `yolov3.cfg`, and `coco.names` in the `models` folder.

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. The server will run locally on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. API Endpoints:
   - **POST** `/process_image`: Accepts an image file for processing.
   - **GET** `/results/<filename>`: Fetches the processed results.
